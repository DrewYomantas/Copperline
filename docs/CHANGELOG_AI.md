### 2026-03-19 - Pass 50a / 51a: Stale Draft Refresh Workflow

**Goal:** Make stale first-touch outreach rows faster to repair from the queue
and review panel without weakening observation-led drafting rules or changing
send/scheduler behavior.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`:
- Added a dedicated stale row action in the Outreach queue:
  - `Add Obs` when the row has no saved observation
  - `Refresh` when the row already has an observation but still needs rebuild
- Added `openPanelForRefresh(...)` so stale rows open the existing review panel
  directly into observation-edit mode instead of forcing extra clicks.
- Added stale-aware review helpers:
  - `panelFocusObservation(...)`
  - `_panelNextStaleIndex(...)`
  - `panelJumpNextStale()`
  - `panelRegenerateAndNextStale()`
- Updated the existing "Refresh before send" panel block to show direct stale
  actions:
  - `Add/Edit observation`
  - `Regenerate now`
  - `Next stale` when another stale row exists in the current review set
- Updated the review flow bar so stale rows can use `Regen + Next Stale`
  without closing the panel.
- Review session chrome now shows stale-row counts to make cleanup progress
  visible during review.
- Regenerate failures now keep the operator focused on the observation field and
  surface the blocked reason in-panel; no backend-only failure state.

**Design decisions:**
- Did not change `dashboard_server.py`.
- Did not change `email_draft_agent.py`.
- Did not change queue schema order/names.
- Did not change scheduler timing or due-date math.
- Did not add auto-observation generation or silent bulk regeneration.

**Verification:**
- Dashboard JS parses clean via `new vm.Script(...)`.
- Live local app:
  - `GET /api/status` -> `200` with current draft version `v9`
  - `GET /api/queue` -> `200` with `180` rows and `130` stale rows under current rules
  - served HTML includes `openPanelForRefresh`, `panelJumpNextStale`,
    and `panelRegenerateAndNextStale`
- Real stale-row block preserved:
  `POST /api/regenerate_draft` for `Integrity Auto Care` -> `400` with
  `blocked_reason=observation_missing`

**Commit:** `5b43aaa`

### 2026-03-19 - Pass 53: Industry Saturation View

**Goal:** Add a truthful industry saturation view to the discovery map so the
operator can choose not only where to search next, but which industries in that
territory are underworked, actively worked, or saturated.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`
- `docs/DISCOVERY_MAP_VISION.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`:
- Added an `Industry Saturation` toggle to the territory toolbar.
- Added a visible-territory industry coverage section built from the existing
  territory overlay payload.
- Added `Best Next Industries` suggestions for the current map view.
- Added `Working Area Industry Mix` for the territory cell under the current
  working circle.
- Added `Set Industry` actions so the operator can push a suggested industry
  into the existing map search selector without auto-running a search.
- Kept the heuristic deterministic and coarse by using only stored per-cell
  lead counts, area-search counts, duplicate-heavy counts, found counts, and
  AREA planner checks/leads.

**Design decisions:**
- Did not change `dashboard_server.py`.
- Did not rewrite territory cells into polygon or county boundaries.
- Did not remove the existing circle because discovery remains center/radius
  based underneath.
- Did not add any auto-search or auto-selection behavior.

**Verification:**
- Dashboard JS parses clean via `new vm.Script(...)`.
- Flask test client:
  - `GET /api/map_territory_overlay` -> `200`
  - `GET /api/industries` -> `200`
- Current overlay summary still reflects:
  `226` area-search rows, `11` AREA planner rows, and `613`
  coordinate-bearing prospects.

**Commit:** `f2ac842`

### 2026-03-18 - Pass 50: Follow-Up System Rebuild

**Goal:** Rebuild follow-up drafting so follow-ups become grounded, state-aware
continuation messages tied to the actual lead record, with deterministic blocking
instead of generic nurture-style fallback copy.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/outreach/followup_draft_agent.py` (new)
- `lead_engine/outreach/followup_scheduler.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_engine/outreach/followup_draft_agent.py` (new):
- Added deterministic follow-up planner `build_followup_plan(row, touch_num)`.
- Added five explicit angle families:
  `observation_continuation`, `operational_nudge`, `note_reframe`,
  `timeline_reframe`, `low_pressure_closeout`.
- Planner now consumes safe existing context only:
  current observation, obs history, timeline detail, conversation notes,
  conversation next step, send timing, contact history, and email-path gating.
- Added deterministic validation/blocking with structured reasons:
  `insufficient_context`, `generic_context`, `contact_path_not_email`,
  `invalid_banned_language`, `invalid_hard_cta`, `invalid_generic_copy`,
  `invalid_missing_context_overlap`, `invalid_not_continuation`,
  `invalid_too_long`.
- Explicitly prefers no follow-up over weak or swappable copy.

`lead_engine/outreach/followup_scheduler.py`:
- Preserved scheduler timing / due-date logic and queue write flow.
- Replaced inline follow-up copy generation with the shared planner.
- Added `blocked` and `blocked_reasons` counters to scheduler stats.
- Scheduler now skips context-poor rows cleanly instead of writing generic drafts.

`lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`:
- `POST /api/run_followups_dry_run` now returns both ready previews and blocked previews.
- `GET /api/followup_queue` now annotates rows with follow-up copy readiness,
  angle family, context source, and blocked reason/message.
- `POST /api/send_followup` now uses the shared planner and returns structured
  blocked responses before any send attempt when context is weak.
- Successful direct sends now record `EVT_FOLLOWUP_SENT`.

`lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`:
- Follow-Up run toast now reports blocked rows when applicable.
- Dry-run console preview now prints ready rows and blocked rows separately.
- Follow-Up cards now show angle/source metadata when copy is ready.
- Follow-Up cards now show blocker text when safe copy is unavailable.
- Auto-send button is hidden for rows that are not due or do not have ready follow-up copy.
  Manual/open workflow remains available.

**Design decisions:**
- Did not touch `run_lead_engine.py`.
- Did not change queue column order or naming.
- Did not rewrite sender core.
- Did not change follow-up timing math; this pass is drafting/validation only.
- Dropped fallback use of old first-touch body text as a follow-up anchor because
  it produced unsafe/generic continuations on real queue rows.

**Verification:**
- `python` imports clean for `outreach.followup_draft_agent`,
  `outreach.followup_scheduler`, and `dashboard_server`.
- Dashboard JS parses clean via `new vm.Script(...)`.
- Flask test client:
  - `POST /api/run_followups_dry_run` -> `200`
  - `GET /api/followup_queue` -> `200`
  - real blocked send check on current due row `Lars Plumbing` ->
    `422` with `blocked_reason=insufficient_context`
- Deterministic sample planning verified for grounded step-1 and step-2 follow-ups.

**Commit:** `4ab7bd5`

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 43: V2 Stage 2F — Next-Action-Driven Controls + History Visibility

### 2026-03-18 - Pass 49: Observation Model Expansion

**Goal:** Make the observation field smarter and more informative — richer
structure, quality grading, revision history, "why this lead now?" reasoning,
and explicit contact-path recommendation — without touching protected systems
or the queue schema.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/lead_memory.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- docs (3 files)

**What changed:**

`lead_memory.py`:
- Module docstring updated to document Pass 49 obs_history model.
- `record_event()`: when `event_type == EVT_OBSERVATION_ADDED`, archives
  `{ ts, prior, text }` into `obs_history[]` on the record and updates
  `current_observation`. Non-breaking — existing records gain the field
  on the next observation save.
- `get_obs_history(row)`: new public function. Returns `obs_history[]`
  sorted oldest-first. Returns `[]` if no record or no history.
- `grade_observation(obs)`: new deterministic grader. No AI. Six grades
  evaluated in order:
  - `empty` — blank input
  - `too_short` — under 15 chars
  - `generic` — matches a known generic phrase list
  - `category_only` — under 40 chars with no specific signal words
  - `tied_to_workflow` — has 2+ specific signal words (website, reviews,
    form, schedule, juggling, seasonal, gap, etc.)
  - `specific` — everything else that passes the length check
  Returns `{ grade, label, tone, message, chars, words }`.

`dashboard_server.py`:
- `api_update_observation`: now returns `grade` and `obs_history_count`
  alongside `ok` and `observation`. Grade computed from the saved text.
- New `POST /api/obs_grade`: stateless, writes nothing. Grades a text
  string and returns `{ ok, grade }`. Safe to call from any context.
- New `POST /api/obs_history`: accepts any identity signal
  (business_name, website, phone, place_id, city). Returns
  `{ ok, key, current_observation, obs_history, grade }`.

`index.html`:
- New CSS: obs grade bar (6 visual states by grade/tone), obs history
  strip, "why now" card, contact-path chip (5 path variants).
- HTML: grade bar div (`panel-obs-grade-bar`), history toggle
  (`panel-obs-history-toggle`), history list (`panel-obs-history-list`)
  inserted inside obs section. `panel-why-now` div inserted after
  `panel-timeline-strip` in Business Info section.
- `_obsRenderGradeBar(obs)`: client-side grade logic mirrors server (no
  network call). Renders pill + message + char count on every keystroke.
- `_panelPopulateObs()` extended: calls `_obsRenderGradeBar` on open,
  calls `_loadObsHistory(row)` non-blocking at end.
- `panelObsChanged()` extended: calls `_obsRenderGradeBar(obs)` on every
  input event.
- `_loadObsHistory(row)`: async, non-blocking. Fetches `/api/obs_history`,
  builds revision list HTML, shows toggle only when 2+ entries exist.
  Resets on every panel open.
- `panelObsHistoryToggle()`: toggles the history list, updates arrow glyph.
- `_contactPathRecommendation(record)`: returns `{ path, chipClass, icon,
  reason }`. Priority: DNC → replied → sent → scheduled → no-contact-enrich
  → email → facebook → instagram → form → enrich.
- `_buildWhyNowCard(row)`: builds chip row from `_leadRecord`. Positive
  chips: obs on file, email reachable, high score, replied, not yet
  contacted. Warning chips: stale draft, draft with no obs. Negative:
  no contact info. Contact-path chip appended below reasons.
- `_renderWhyNowCard(row)`: writes card HTML into `panel-why-now`, hides
  div when card is empty (sent + not replied).
- `_renderWhyNowCard(row)` wired into `fillPanel()` alongside
  `_loadPanelTimeline`.

**Design decisions:**
- Grade bar is fully client-side. The server `/api/obs_grade` endpoint
  exists for future use (e.g. batch audits, API callers) but the panel
  does not call it — zero latency on every keystroke matters here.
- History toggle only appears when obs_history has 2+ entries. A single
  save has no "prior" worth showing.
- Why-now card is suppressed for sent+not-replied rows — there is nothing
  actionable to surface there.
- Contact-path recommendation is one chip, one reason. No ambiguity list.

**No protected systems touched. No queue schema changes.**

**Verification:**
- `python -c "import lead_memory; import dashboard_server"` clean.
- JS extracted and `vm.Script` syntax check: clean.
- 15/15 targeted checks passed: all new functions defined, wired into
  correct call sites, all HTML elements present, grade bar uses
  client-side logic, obs_history endpoint called correctly.

**Commit:** pending

### 2026-03-18 - Pass 48: Lifecycle Coverage Expansion

**Goal:** Fill in the remaining high-value lifecycle events so the timeline
is meaningfully complete for normal operator work without touching protected systems.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/lead_memory.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- docs (4 files)

**What changed:**

`lead_memory.py`:
- Added `EVT_APPROVED`, `EVT_UNAPPROVED`, `EVT_SCHEDULED`, `EVT_UNSCHEDULED`
  to constants, `_ALL_EVENT_TYPES`, and `_EVENT_LABELS`.

`dashboard_server.py`:
- `api_approve_row`: records `EVT_APPROVED` after queue write.
- `api_unapprove_row`: records `EVT_UNAPPROVED` after queue write.
- `api_schedule_email`: records `EVT_SCHEDULED` (detail=send_after) when
  setting a schedule, `EVT_UNSCHEDULED` when clearing. All try/except wrapped.

`index.html`:
- `_TL_ICON` and `_TL_COLOR` extended for approved (✓ green), unapproved
  (✗ muted), scheduled (🕐 blue), unscheduled (○ muted).

**Intentional non-hooks:**
- `discovered`: post-pipeline row attribution is too risky without protected code.
- `EVT_DRAFTED`: run_pipeline is protected.
- `EVT_FOLLOWUP_SENT`: deferred to Pass 50.
- `suppressed`, `revived`, `deleted_intentionally`: already recorded as
  state-transition entries via `record_suppression()` — no new hooks needed.

**Commit:** `e8d8312`

---

### 2026-03-18 - Pass 47: Lead Timeline / Lifecycle Event Spine

**Goal:** Introduce durable per-lead event history that records key lifecycle
actions in one place, giving narrative continuity to the lead record beyond
just current suppression state.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/lead_memory.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_memory.py`:
- Updated docstring documenting the two-entry-type history model.
- `EVT_*` constants: `EVT_DRAFTED`, `EVT_OBSERVATION_ADDED`, `EVT_DRAFT_REGENERATED`,
  `EVT_REPLIED`, `EVT_NOTE_ADDED`, `EVT_FOLLOWUP_SENT`. All registered in `_ALL_EVENT_TYPES`.
- `_EVENT_LABELS` and `_STATE_LABELS` dicts for UI rendering.
- `record_event(row, event_type, *, detail, operator)`: appends `type='event'` entry to
  `history[]` without changing `current_state`. Creates lead record if none exists.
  Event-only records are not suppressed (`is_suppressed()` returns False).
- `get_timeline(row)`: returns full `history[]` sorted oldest-first. Back-fills
  `type='state'` and `label` for pre-Pass-47 entries that lack those fields.
  Returns `[]` if no memory record exists.

`dashboard_server.py` — 4 lifecycle hooks (all try/except wrapped):
- `api_update_observation`: records `EVT_OBSERVATION_ADDED` with `detail=obs[:120]`.
- `api_regenerate_draft`: records `EVT_DRAFT_REGENERATED` on success.
- `api_update_conversation`: records `EVT_NOTE_ADDED` when notes field is non-empty.
- `api_log_contact` result=replied: records `EVT_REPLIED` with `detail=channel`.
- New `POST /api/lead_timeline`: returns full timeline by lead identity
  (accepts business_name, website, phone, place_id, city).

`index.html`:
- `panel-timeline-strip` div inserted below `panel-meta` in panel HTML.
- `_TL_ICON` and `_TL_COLOR` lookup maps for timeline rendering.
- `_loadPanelTimeline(row)`: fetches `/api/lead_timeline`, non-blocking.
  Called at end of `fillPanel` — does not delay panel render.
- `_timelineStripHtml(timeline)`: renders last 6 events as compact icon+label
  dots with hover tooltips for full detail. Shows "+N more" when truncated.
- Lead Memory tab `memFilterRender`: event count replaced with clickable
  "N events ▾" button. Header row now shows Events column (was count-only).
- `memToggleTimeline(key, bizName, website, btn, rowId)`: toggles/lazy-loads
  full timeline in an inline `<tr>` detail row. Fetches once per row
  (`dataset.loaded='1'` guard). Renders icon, label, timestamp, detail per entry.

**No protected systems touched. No queue schema changes.**

**Verification:**
- `python -c "import lead_memory; import dashboard_server"` clean.
- `node --check` on extracted JS clean.
- 6/6 checks passed: record_event without state change, event-only record not
  suppressed, get_timeline sort + back-fill, legacy entry back-fill, EVT_*
  constants registered, real memory file integrity unchanged.

**Commit:** `4a4a04b`

### 2026-03-18 - Pass 46: Contacted Memory Seeding + Safer Contact Recording

**Goal:** Backfill lead_memory with existing contacted leads, and ensure all future
contact events are recorded automatically with minimal operator friction.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/scripts/seed_contacted_memory.py` (new)
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`scripts/seed_contacted_memory.py` (new):
- One-shot idempotent seed script for existing real-sent queue rows.
- Uses `is_real_send()` as gate: 34 rows with confirmed message_id seeded,
  16 logged-only rows (no message_id) intentionally excluded.
- Skips rows already in memory — preserves existing states (do_not_contact, hold, etc.).
- Dry-run by default; `--write` flag to commit to `lead_memory.json`.
- Executed: 34/34 seeded, all with `web:` identity keys, 0 skipped.

`dashboard_server.py`:
- `api_log_contact`: when `result == 'sent'`, calls `_lm.record_suppression(row, 'contacted')`.
  Wrapped in try/except — memory failure never blocks the contact log operation.
  Forward-looking: all future manual contact logs auto-record to memory.

`index.html`:
- 'Mark Contacted' button added to panel footer (`id=panel-mark-contacted-btn`).
  Hidden (`display:none`) for rows where `sent_at` is already set; visible for unsent rows.
- `fillPanel` visibility block updated to toggle the button alongside approve/schedule.
- `panelMarkContacted()` JS function: calls `/api/suppress_lead` with `state='contacted'`.
  Hides itself on success, shows confirmation toast.

**Design decisions:**
- Seed uses `is_real_send()` not just `sent_at`: 16 rows have `sent_at` but no `message_id`
  (logged-only, unconfirmed sends). These are intentionally excluded from the seed.
- `api_log_contact` hook chosen over `api_send_approved`: the log_contact endpoint is the
  correct manual contact surface; the send_approved path is adjacent to protected systems.
- Button hidden for already-sent rows: prevents confusion and double-recording.

**No protected systems touched. No queue schema changes.**

**Verification:**
- `python -c "import dashboard_server"` clean.
- `node --check` on extracted JS clean.
- 6/6 checks passed: is_real_send count, contacted suppression, skip-existing logic,
  api_log_contact hook, panelMarkContacted path, real memory file integrity.

**Commit:** `65d113e`

### 2026-03-18 - Pass 45: Durable Memory Coverage Hardening

**Goal:** Extend suppression filtering consistently to all remaining discovery entry points so no bypass paths exist.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`api_discover` (city-based discovery):
- Reads `include_suppressed` from POST body (default False).
- Filters rows returned by `discover_prospects` before passing to `run_pipeline`.
  Suppressed rows are never re-drafted into the queue.
- Returns `suppressed_skipped` count in all success responses.
- New `all_suppressed: True` response state when every discovered row is suppressed.

`api_discover_area_batch` (exhaust-mode discovery):
- Reads `include_suppressed` from POST body (default False).
- Per-iteration `_lm.is_suppressed(r)` check before appending to `all_markers`.
- Adds `suppressed` flag to each marker object (consistent with Pass 44 `api_discover_area`).
- Accumulates `total_suppressed_skipped` across all iterations.
- Returns `suppressed_skipped` in final response.

**No other ingest paths require changes:**
- `api_discover_area`: already done in Pass 44.
- `api_run_pipeline`: protected-adjacent, not a discovery entry point.

**Suppression coverage after Pass 45:**

| Route | Where filtered | Override param |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/discover` | Before `run_pipeline` | `include_suppressed` in body |
| `POST /api/discover_area` | Marker list (Pass 44) | `include_suppressed` query param |
| `POST /api/discover_area_batch` | Per-iteration marker build | `include_suppressed` in body |

**No protected systems touched. No queue schema changes. No frontend changes.**

**Verification:**
- `python -c "import dashboard_server"` — clean.
- 4/4 logic checks passed: api_discover filter, include_suppressed override, batch filter, batch include_suppressed with suppressed flag tagging.

**Commit:** `e7c382c`

---

### 2026-03-18 - Pass 44: Durable Lead Memory + Suppression Registry

**Goal:** Ensure leads that were contacted, deleted, suppressed, held, or opted-out are durably remembered and do not casually resurface in fresh discovery. Provide an operator-accessible inspector and revive path.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/lead_memory.py` (new)
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_memory.py` (new standalone module):
- Persists to `lead_engine/data/lead_memory.json` — fully independent of queue CSV.
- Identity key mirrors frontend `_leadKey()`: `pid:` > `web:` > `ph:` > `nc:name|city`.
- Suppression states: `contacted`, `suppressed`, `deleted_intentionally`, `do_not_contact`, `hold`, `revived`.
- All writes are lock-protected with atomic tmp-then-rename.
- Public API: `record_suppression`, `revive_lead`, `is_suppressed`, `get_record`, `get_suppressed_keys`, `suppressed_identity_sets`, `lead_key`.

`dashboard_server.py`:
- `import lead_memory as _lm` added.
- `api_delete_row` — records `deleted_intentionally` before queue pop. Memory survives deletion.
- `api_opt_out_row` — records `do_not_contact` in durable memory after queue write.
- `POST /api/suppress_lead` — operator-triggered suppression with explicit state.
- `POST /api/revive_lead` — clears suppression, adds `revived` history entry.
- `GET /api/lead_memory` — all records, filterable by `suppressed_only` and `q`.
- `POST /api/lead_memory/check` — single-lead suppression check by any identity signal.
- `api_discover_area` markers — suppressed leads excluded from default results; `?include_suppressed=1` to override.
- All memory calls wrapped in try/except — failure never blocks a queue operation.

`index.html`:
- Hold button added to panel footer — suppresses from discovery without deleting the row.
- Tools nav gains Lead Memory sub-tab with searchable, filterable record table.
- Per-row Revive button for suppressed leads in the memory inspector.
- `_runPageHooks` wired: navigating to `lead-memory` auto-loads the table.

**No protected systems touched. No queue schema changes.**

**Verification:**
- `python -c "import lead_memory; import dashboard_server"` — both clean.
- `node --check` on extracted dashboard JS — clean.
- 6/6 functional checks passed (deleted_intentionally, hold, revive, do_not_contact, suppressed_identity_sets, revived absent from suppressed_keys).

**Commit:** `e4cfc38`

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 43: V2 Stage 2F — Next-Action-Driven Controls + History Visibility

**Goal:** Make operator controls and visibility cues follow the shared lead record model more clearly so the next step is easier to see and act on.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**
- Added shared UI helpers: `_leadNeedsDraftRefresh`, `_leadHistoryItems`, `_leadHistoryChipsHtml`, `_leadNextActionContext`, and `_leadControlGuidance`.
- Shared header and status renderers now lean on `_leadStatusMeta(_leadRecord(...))` for clearer blocked/sent/replied/stale meaning.
- Queue status cells now show shared history chips for approved, scheduled, sent, replied, stale, and observation-present state.
- `_leadRecord.nextAction` now prioritizes stale / missing-observation refresh work before send-oriented actions.
- Review panel footer actions, discovery list actions, flow notes, and preview-modal buttons now relabel and emphasize controls from shared control guidance.

**No backend changes. No queue schema changes. No protected systems touched.**

**Verification:**
- `node --check` clean on extracted dashboard JS.
- Live dashboard verified at `http://127.0.0.1:5051`.
- Port `5000` was occupied by another local app, so verification used `5051`.

**Commit:** `5a09991`

---

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 42: V2 Stage 2E — Qualification + Status Derivation Unification

**Goal:** Centralize qualification bucket and status badge/label derivation so Discovery and Pipeline use the same shared helpers, not parallel inline logic.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**
- `_leadRecord` extended: `hasWebsite`, `hasPhone`, `isStale`, `isReadyScheduled` added.
- `_leadQualBucket(record, extras)` — shared qualification bucket (ready/maybe/needs-contact/weak/closed).
- `_leadStatusMeta(record)` — shared status badge/label/subline/detail/tone.
- `_queueStateMeta` rewritten as `return _leadStatusMeta(_leadRecord(row))`.
- `_mapPanelQualification` rewritten as thin wrapper over `_leadRecord` + `_leadQualBucket`.

**No backend changes. No queue schema changes. No protected systems touched.**
All caller shapes preserved.

**Commit:** `118b787`

---

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 41: V2 Stage 2D — Stable Key Propagation + Stronger Discovery-Queue Linking

**Goal:** Replace `_mrpResolveRow`'s fuzzy name+city scan with a stable key-indexed lookup. Website (90% coverage, 0 collisions) and phone (99%, 0 collisions) are now the primary match signals.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**
- `_leadKeyIndex = new Map()` module var added alongside `allRows`.
- `_buildLeadKeyIndex(rows)` function: builds Map from `_leadKey(row)` for all rows. Called in `loadAll()` after `allRows` assignment.
- `_mrpResolveRow(biz)` rewritten: Layer 1 = `_leadKeyIndex.get(_leadKey(biz))` exact lookup; Layer 2 = name+city scan fallback; Layer 3 = name-only last resort (compat preserved).

**No backend changes. No queue schema changes. No protected systems touched.**
All `_mrpResolveRow` call sites unchanged.

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 40: V2 Stage 2C — Shared Row State Rendering

**Goal:** Reduce duplicated row-state logic between Discovery and Pipeline renders. Add observation visibility and next-action hints to both views consistently.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**
- Added `_leadStatusPills(record)` — shared pill renderer from `_leadRecord`. Replaces both inline `mrp-status-pills` blocks in `_mapRenderPanel`. Now also shows observation tag in Discovery list items.
- Added `_leadNextActionHint(record)` — shared next-action hint HTML. Added to both Discovery list renders.
- Both `_mapRenderPanel` pill blocks replaced with `_leadStatusPills` + `_leadNextActionHint` via `_leadRecord(qrow)`.
- `statusCellHtml` subline extended: `obs` tag appended when observation present; `nextAction` text appended when unsent.

**No backend changes. No queue schema changes. No protected systems touched.**

**Commit:** `8abbb57`

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 39: V2 Stage 2A+2B — Unified Lead Record + Workspace Panel

**Goal:** Introduce a canonical lead record shape and shared workspace panel header so Discovery and Pipeline read/write through the same data model for a business.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Stage 2A — new functions:**
- `_leadKey(input)` — stable identity key from biz or queue row
- `_leadResolve(input)` — resolves to `{ biz, qrow, key }` from either input
- `_leadRecord(input)` — canonical normalizer covering identity, contact, qualification, status, draft, observation, history

**Stage 2B — new functions + wiring:**
- `_STATUS_TONE_STYLES` — shared status badge style map
- `_renderLeadWorkspaceHeader(record)` — shared HTML for status + channels + score + obs tag + next action
- Wired into `fillPanel` (Pipeline panel meta section)
- Wired into `_mrpPreview` (Discovery map modal header)
- `mrp-modal-lws-header` div added to modal HTML

**No backend changes. No queue schema changes. No protected systems touched.**
All existing send/approve/schedule/unschedule behavior preserved.

**Commit:** `40f7db2`

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 38: Pre-Pass-36 Queue State Cleanup (Bulk Unschedule)

**Type:** Operational state management. No product code changed.

**Goal:** Stop 56 old-style (v7 draft) scheduled rows from auto-sending tomorrow morning without losing any lead identity or contact history.

**What happened:**
- Inspected `pending_emails.csv`: 56 rows scheduled+unsent, all `draft_version=v7`, all targeting 2026-03-18 windows.
- Backed up queue to `_backups/pending_emails_pre_p38_20260317_182909.csv`.
- Cleared `send_after` on all 56 rows. No other fields touched.
- Verified: total rows 180→180, sent rows 50→50, scheduled+unsent 56→0.
- All assertions passed.

**Files changed (docs only — queue is gitignored):**
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Commit:** `b12cf5e`

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 37: Discovery Review Recovery + Action Feedback

**Goal:** Fix operator friction introduced by recent dashboard passes — restore editable map preview, add pending-state feedback, fix backdrop close with drag guard, surface Unschedule clearly.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`index.html`:
- Added `_panelMousedownOnBackdrop` state variable for drag-close guard.
- Added `_panelOverlayMousedown(e)` — sets flag only when mousedown lands on the backdrop itself.
- Rewrote `closePanelOnOverlay` — now performs real close instead of toast-only block. Requires mousedown origin to have been the backdrop; pending saves still temporarily block.
- Wired `onmousedown="_panelOverlayMousedown(event)"` onto the overlay element.
- Added `_btnPending(btn, label)` and `_btnRestore(btn)` shared helpers.
- `panelApprove` — pending state (Approving...), try/catch, restore.
- `panelUnapprove` — pending state (Removing...), try/catch, restore.
- `panelScheduleTomorrow` — pending state (Scheduling...), restore on all exit paths.
- `panelUnschedule` — pending state (Clearing...), restore.
- `mrp-modal` HTML — replaced `<pre>` + static subject `<div>` with `<input>` + `<textarea>` + save-status line.
- `_mrpPreview` — fully rewritten: populates inputs, wires Save Edits (calls `/api/update_row`), Approve, Unschedule (for scheduled rows) / Schedule Tomorrow (for unscheduled), Delete, Close — all with pending state.

**No backend changes. No protected systems touched.**

**Verification:**
- `node --check` clean on extracted dashboard JS.
- `python -c "import dashboard_server"` clean.
- All change sites confirmed via targeted search (line numbers documented in CURRENT_BUILD.md).

**Commit:** `4224d78`

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 36: Observation-Led Outreach Rewrite

**Goal:** Rewrite first-touch email and DM generation so every draft is observation-led, business-specific, and invalid when generic. This is a product rule change — not copy polish.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`email_draft_agent.py` (v8 → v9):
- Removed all previous industry-angle templates. Generation is now entirely observation-driven.
- Added `ObservationMissingError` and `DraftInvalidError` for structured failure signaling.
- Added `_require_observation()` — fails if observation is absent or under 15 chars.
- Added `_is_generic_observation()` — rejects category labels ("noticed you do roofing") that would fit most businesses in the category.
- Added `validate_draft()` — deterministic validation blocking banned buzzwords, hard CTAs, links, pricing, sender-centered filler openers, and observation-absent drafts.
- Added three controlled variation families (A/B/C). No open-ended variation allowed.
- `draft_email()` and `draft_social_messages()` both require observation. Both fail clearly with `ObservationMissingError` if absent.
- Added prefix normalization so observations starting with "saw"/"noticed" don't double-stack with the variant prefix.

`dashboard_server.py`:
- Added `business_specific_observation` as final column in `PENDING_COLUMNS`. Additive, non-send-path, safe for existing rows via DictReader `.get()`.
- Added `/api/update_observation` — persists observation, rejects absent/short/generic values.
- Added `/api/regenerate_draft` — requires observation (stored or inline override). Returns structured `blocked_reason` field. On success writes new subject/body/DM drafts to queue row.

`index.html`:
- Added observation CSS block.
- Added observation panel section (textarea, hint, required/status tag, regen button, status line).
- Added `_panelPopulateObs(row)` wired into `fillPanel()` — hydrates field, shows blocked state when observation absent.
- Added `panelObsChanged(value)` — live handler that enables/disables regen button and updates hint text.
- Added `panelRegenerateDraft()` — calls `/api/regenerate_draft`, updates panel fields on success, shows structured blocked/invalid reason on failure.

**Verification:**
- `python -m py_compile` clean on both Python files.
- `node --check` clean on extracted dashboard JS.
- 23/23 targeted checks passed: blocking, generic rejection, validation layer, observation-in-body requirement, variation distinctness, field-vs-arg routing.

**No protected systems touched:** `run_lead_engine.py`, sender core, scheduler core, follow-up system, and queue pipeline behavior are all unchanged.

**Commit:** `00add5d`

---

### 2026-03-17 — Docs Governance Pass: Bounded Cohesive Pass Model

**Goal:** Update AI repo instructions to replace ultra-small surgical pass model with bounded cohesive pass model.

**Type:** Documentation/governance pass only. No product code changed. No protected systems touched.

**What changed:**

`AI_DEV_STANDARDS.md`
- Replaced "Small incremental passes / No multi-feature commits" principle with "Bounded cohesive passes" principle
- Added Pass Scoping Rules section with explicit correct/incorrect scope examples
- Updated prohibited behavior: changed "make large multi-feature commits" to "bundle unrelated systems in a single pass"
- Typical pass size guidance added: 1–6 files, no hard max, but larger passes require stronger cohesion justification

`AI_START_HERE.md`
- Updated onboarding framing: new sessions now think in bounded implementation blocks, not artificially tiny passes
- Added "How to scope a pass" section with good/bad examples
- Updated file path references to match actual docs location (removed stale `docs/` prefixes)

`AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- Updated Current Focus, Current Build Pass, Last Completed Pass, and Next Pass to reflect Pass 18b (was stale at Pass 14)
- Added Execution Model section documenting bounded cohesive pass rules with examples
- Updated Last Updated date to 2026-03-17

**Files changed:**
- `docs/AI_DEV_STANDARDS.md`
- `docs/AI_START_HERE.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Commit:** `aaa3276`

---

### 2026-03-16 — Pass 11D: Industry Send Window UX Refinement

**Goal:** Make scheduling feel deliberate and industry-tailored while preserving manual Gmail sending and existing `send_after` queue semantics.

**Changes:**
- Added industry send-window helpers (`_industryWindowTime`, `_industryWindowLabel`, `_buildSendAfterFromWindow`) for coherent, operator-visible scheduling defaults.
- Updated review panel schedule actions and labels: `Tomorrow @ Best Time`, `Schedule for Best Time`, `Next Best Window`
- Enhanced schedule info block with compact guidance: industry default-time explanation, clear Approved vs Scheduled distinction
- Kept `panelUnschedule`, scheduled ordering, and all send behavior unchanged.

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Commit:** `3413dbb`

---

### 2026-03-16 — Pass 11C: Discovery-to-Queue Continuity UX

**Goal:** Reduce context-switch friction between map discovery and queue processing without introducing fake campaign abstractions.

**Changes:**
- Added a persistent discovery handoff bar under top navigation with truthful post-run summary and direct actions: Review New Drafts, Continue Discovering, Return to Last Discovery Area
- Added lightweight session state: `_lastDiscoveryHandoff`, `_lastDiscoveryMapContext`, `_captureMapContext(...)`, `_publishDiscoveryHandoff(...)`
- Wired handoff publishing into successful discovery flows (`discoverLeads`, `mapSearch`, `mapSearchVisible`).
- Added map-context restore behavior so operators can jump to queue and return to the previous discovery area quickly.
- No backend changes; discovery remains explicit/operator-triggered.

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Commit:** `70f1f96`

---

### 2026-03-16 — Pass 11B: Separate Sent Workspace / Completed Outreach View

**Goal:** Keep the live unsent queue clean by moving completed outreach into a separate destination view.

**Changes:**
- Added a dedicated Sent Workspace page (`page-sentview`) with its own header, stats, and table.
- Kept live queue default on unsent work and preserved existing queue-state filter semantics.
- Added Sent Workspace context using existing fields: sent time, business, subject, reply badge, follow-up hint.
- Added quick actions from Sent Workspace to Replied filter, Follow-Up queue, and original business row panel.
- Added top-nav Sent badge and wired Sent stage/primary nav to the separate Sent destination.

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Commit:** `3a597b1`

---
### 2026-03-16 — Pass 11A: Pipeline UX V2 Flow Cleanup

**Goal:** Make the operator workflow read as one continuous flow: Discover → Review → Approve/Schedule → Sent → Follow-Up.

**Changes:**
- Simplified top-level navigation to direct destinations (Discovery, Queue, Scheduled, Sent, Follow-Up, Clients, System).
- Added a workflow stage rail inside Outreach with live counts and quick stage jumps.
- Preserved queue-state separation: Actionable (unsent and not scheduled), Scheduled (send_after and not sent), Sent (sent_at), Replied.
- Improved queue empty-state messaging for mode-switch scenarios.
- Kept send behavior, queue schema, and backend routes unchanged.

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Commit:** `84d4a7b`

---

### 2026-03-16 — Pass 16: Outreach Command-Center Refinement

**Goal:** Improve operator clarity in Outreach by tightening immediate-work semantics and visually separating discovery, queue filtering, and queue actions.

**Changes:**
- Tightened `Actionable` definition to exclude stale-draft and missing-email rows in addition to scheduled/sent/terminal rows.
- Reorganized Outreach layout into clear stacked groups: Discovery controls, Queue workflow filters/view controls, and Queue actions.
- Grouped review/reconciliation tools separately from the primary send action (`▶ Send Approved`).
- Added secondary row treatment and note labels (`stale draft`, `missing email`, `low fit`).

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `7da49b5`

---

### 2026-03-16 — Pass 15: Outreach Queue Regression Fix

**Goal:** Restore queue/stats/industry/table loading after the command-center cleanup regression.

**Root cause:** `loadAll()` used `Promise.all` for `/api/status` + `/api/queue`, so a failure from either endpoint aborted both. `loadIndustries()` silently swallowed API failures.

**Changes:**
- Updated `loadAll()` to `Promise.allSettled` with independent status/queue application and endpoint-specific operator toasts.
- Added diagnostics (`console.error`) for status and queue failures.
- Added resilient `loadIndustries()` fallback options.

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `347a842`

# AI Development Log

Chronological record of all AI-assisted implementation passes on the Copperline project.

## 2026-03-16

### Pass 20c — Live Scheduler Verification

**Goal:** Verify the automated scheduled-send system end-to-end against the live codebase.

**Files changed:** None (verification only).

**Results: 17/17 checks passed.**

- `CSV_WRITE_LOCK` confirmed as real mutex
- `_scheduler_started` guard confirmed no-op on second call
- Exactly 1 daemon thread `copperline-scheduler` running
- `_is_send_eligible`: future returns False, past-due returns True, no send_after returns True
- `send_next_due_email` returns False with no due rows; injected past-due row correctly selected
- Future row injected and confirmed NOT selected

**SMTP boundary:** Not tested end-to-end. Verification covers all logic up to `_send_email_via_gmail()` call site.

**Verdict: READY for overnight scheduled sending.**

**Commit:** `76be407` (Pass 20a, last code change — no new code this pass)

---
### Pass 18b — Human Draft Enforcement Layer

**Goal:** Add a post-processing layer to `draft_email()` that enforces human-style copy constraints after generation.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`

**What changed:**

Added two new module-level constants:
- `_FORMAL_OPENER_SUBS` — list of `(pattern, replacement)` pairs for stripping/rewriting formal phrases and secondary banned words
- `_WORD_TARGET_MAX = 65` — soft word ceiling for body_text (sign-off excluded)

Added new function `enforce_human_style(body_text: str) -> str`:
- Applies all `_FORMAL_OPENER_SUBS` substitutions
- Lowercases opener on lines starting with `"Hey "` (not `"Hi "` — intentional)
- Trims to `_WORD_TARGET_MAX` by dropping last paragraph block if over limit — never mid-sentence

Wired call into `draft_email()` between body assembly and sign-off append.

**Sample output verified (5 drafts):** 54–65 words, 2–3 sentences per output, no formal phrases.

**No schema changes. No DRAFT_VERSION bump. No protected systems touched.**

**Commit:** `ff7564d`

---

### Pass 18a — Discovery State Reset (Phase 2)

**Goal:** Reset discovery-layer data to a clean post-outreach baseline.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/scripts/reset_discovery_state.py` (new)
- `lead_engine/data/prospects.csv` (reset)
- `lead_engine/data/search_history.json` (cleared)
- `lead_engine/data/city_planner.json` (cleared)

**What changed:**
- `prospects.csv`: 231 rows → 43 rows. Kept only businesses matching gmail_sent preserve set. 188 unmatched rows archived.
- `search_history.json`: 31 entries → `[]`. Full backup archived.
- `city_planner.json`: 4 city entries → `{}`. Full backup archived.
- `reset_discovery_state.py`: reusable script with dry-run support, backup-before-write safety, queue integrity check.

**Queue integrity confirmed:** `pending_emails.csv` verified at 26 rows before and after reset.

**Commit:** `970a55c`

---

### Pass 17b — KPI Stats Audit: Relabel Prospects Card

**Goal:** Correct misleading "Prospects" KPI card that shows discovery pool count on the outreach queue page.

**Root cause:** `api_status` returns `prospects_loaded` from `prospects.csv`. After queue reset, live queue dropped to 26 rows but `prospects.csv` was untouched, causing stale display.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**What changed:**
- Renamed stat card label from `Prospects` → `Discovered`
- Added `title` attribute explaining independence from outreach queue

**Commit:** `59d3118`

---

### Pass 17a — Queue Reset: Gmail Preservation Mode

**Goal:** Reset the live outreach queue to a clean state, preserving only the 47 businesses actually contacted via Gmail.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/scripts/reset_queue_from_gmail.py` (new)
- `lead_engine/scripts/gmail_sent_preserve_set_for_reset.csv` (new)
- `lead_engine/queue/pending_emails.csv` (reset)

**Live reset executed:**
- Original queue: 132 rows → Kept (Gmail-matched): 26 rows → Archived to `_backups/`: 106 rows

**Commit:** `8b5723b`

---
### Pass 16a — Bug Stabilization: normalize_business_name, discover 400, None guards

**Goal:** Fix three hard backend failures introduced by prior Codex UX passes.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/discovery/prospect_discovery_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/queue/queue_integrity.py`
- `lead_engine/queue/exception_router.py`

**Failures fixed:**
1. `NameError: normalize_business_name` (routes: `/api/queue_health`, `/api/exceptions`) — added missing function using existing `_NAME_NOISE_WORDS` and `_PUNCT_RE`
2. `/api/discover` and `/api/discover_area` returning 400 on all-duplicates — changed to `200` with `ok: false, all_duplicates: true`
3. `None .lower()` crashes — fixed with `(row.get("approved") or "").lower()`

**Commit:** `7e34d57`

---

### Pass 15b — Outreach Tone Correction: Operational Problem-First Messaging

**Goal:** Correct Pass 15a copy that drifted into generic automation-agency framing.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**What changed:**
- `_OPENING_QUESTIONS` — All three variants rewritten to open on specific operational gap (leads going cold, after-hours drop-off, follow-ups that don't happen).
- `_BODY_FIXED` — Rewritten to lead with what the business is currently losing, not what Copperline offers.
- `cvSendQuick` templates — Reworded to match problem-first framing.
- `DRAFT_VERSION` bumped `v5` → `v6`.

**Commit:** `fix: Pass 15b — correct outreach tone, lead with operational problems not automation framing`

---

### Pass 15a — Outreach Positioning: Remove Missed-Call-First Framing

**Goal:** Replace missed-call-product-first email templates with automation-audit framing.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**What changed:**
- `_OPENING_QUESTIONS`, `_BODY_FIXED` replaced with automation/workflow-oriented variants.
- `_BANNED` — Removed `"automation"`, `"automate"`, `"workflow"` from banned list.
- `DRAFT_VERSION` bumped `v4` → `v5`.

**Note:** This pass introduced automation-agency tone corrected in Pass 15b.

**Commit:** `feat: Pass 15a — reposition outreach templates to automation audit framing`

---

## 2026-03-16

### Pass 11 — Sent Mail Reconciliation Recovery

**Goal:** Prevent duplicate resends when Gmail sends succeeded but dashboard closed before queue state updated.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/outreach/reply_checker.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**What changed:**
- Added `reconcile_sent_mail()` to scan recent Gmail Sent messages and reconcile only approved+unsent queue rows.
- Matching key: recipient email + exact subject, limited to recent sent window (default 72h).
- Ambiguity handling is fail-safe: skip rows when multiple queue rows or Sent messages share a key.
- Added `/api/reconcile_sent` endpoint and UI action `↺ Check Sent`.

**Commit:** `aae0cb5`

---

### Pass 12 — Queue Bulk Action + Unschedule Fix

**Goal:** Restore reliable checked-row bulk approvals and provide explicit unschedule action.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**What changed:**
- Fixed bulk Approve / Unapprove race: replaced parallel `Promise.all` with sequential row updates.
- Changed schedule panel button from `Clear` to `Unschedule`.

**Commit:** `c40d16d`

---
### Pass 13 — Dashboard Startup Import Recovery

**Goal:** Restore dashboard startup by resolving missing symbols/modules in the server import chain.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/discovery/prospect_discovery_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/run_lead_engine.py`
- `lead_engine/intelligence/website_scan_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/scoring/opportunity_scoring_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/city_planner.py`
- `lead_engine/intelligence/email_extractor_agent.py`

**What changed:**
- Added missing `clean_website_for_key()` to discovery agent.
- Removed stale `normalize_business_name` import from `run_lead_engine.py`.
- Added compatibility helpers: `generate_lead_insight`, `draft_social_messages`, `DRAFT_VERSION`, `compute_numeric_score`, `score_priority_label`.
- Added missing modules imported by dashboard server (`city_planner`, `email_extractor_agent`).

**Commit:** `c2234ea`

---

### Pass 14 — Dashboard UX Safety Cleanup

**Goal:** Remove misleading/dead dashboard actions and clarify operator-facing copy.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**What changed:**
- Disabled broken client leads navigation (`mcViewLeads` informational only).
- Added explicit tooltips to disabled client actions.
- Relabeled conversation quick actions to copy-oriented language.
- Added safety confirmation to `Approve All` with affected row count.
- Added map disclosure note for partial marker expectations.
- Marked Tools tab as `Stub` in top navigation.

**Commit:** `014e68c`

---

## 2026-03-15

### Pass A — Operator Safety Fixes

**Goal:** Prevent broken outreach messages and fix confusing UI without touching protected systems.

**Changes:**
- `COPPERLINE_LINKS` config block added at top of JS. `_clinkOr(url, fallback)` helper warns operator if links are unconfigured.
- `cvSendQuick` templates now reference `COPPERLINE_LINKS` via `_clinkOr`. Error toast fires if any link is still default.
- `mcRenderClients` table headers corrected to match actual backend schema.
- `mcRenderClients` tbody cells corrected: `c.phone`, `c.sms_reply`, `c.active`.
- Leads and Delete buttons in client rows: `disabled` + `opacity:.4`.
- Service badge initial text: `● Missed-Call: Not Configured`.

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `4a169dd`

---

### Clients Route Fix

**Root cause:** Frontend calling `/api/mc/clients`, `/api/mc/clients/new`, `/api/mc/run_demo`. Backend implements `/api/clients`, `/api/clients/add`, `/api/demo_run`.

**Fixes:**
- `mcLoadClients()`: `/api/mc/clients` → `/api/clients`
- `mcSaveNewClient()`: `/api/mc/clients/new` → `/api/clients/add`
- `mcRunDemo()`: `/api/mc/run_demo` → `/api/demo_run`
- `mcApi()`: added `r.ok` guard

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `4c390fe`

---

### Runtime Verification Hotfixes

**Root causes found:**
- `api()` called `r.json()` unconditionally on non-OK responses, throwing `SyntaxError`.
- Map `click` event repositioned active circle on any tile click, wiping result markers.
- `Clear Coverage` button near-invisible.

**Fixes:**
- `api()`: added `if (!r.ok)` guard.
- `_mapInit` click handler: wraps `_mapDrawCircle` in `if (_mapResultItems.length === 0)` guard.
- `.btn-coverage`: raised text contrast.

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `2b202cd`

---
### Emergency Fix — Duplicate `let _currentPage` SyntaxError

**Root cause:** Stale duplicate `let _currentPage = 'outreach'` declaration left from Step 1 nav restructure. Browsers enforce strict `let` uniqueness and threw fatal parse error: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier '_currentPage' has already been declared`.

**Fix:** Removed the 5-line stale block. Single declaration remains.

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `761faaf`

---

### Step 7 — Human-Readable Discovery Labels

**Changes:**
- Added `_mapAreaLabel(markers)`: frequency-counts `biz.city`, returns most common city name.
- Wired into `mapSearch()` `res.ok`: computes label before history unshift.
- Updated `_mapRenderHistory()`: `entry.label` as primary (fallback to `lat/lng` coords).

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `3f86767`

---

### Step 6 — Discovery History List

**Changes:**
- Added `_mapSearchHistory[]`, `MAP_HISTORY_MAX = 10`
- Added `_mapRenderHistory()` and `_mapClearHistory()`
- Added `#map-history` HTML below `#map-status` (hidden until first entry)

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `6d79c64`

---

### Step 5 — Discovery Coverage Memory

**Changes:**
- Added `_mapCoverageCircles[]` module variable
- Added `_mapClearCoverage()` and `.btn-coverage` CSS
- Wired `mapSearch()` `res.ok` branch to snapshot search area as faint `L.circle` overlay

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `f27a472`

---

### Step 4 — Map Result Usability Polish

**Changes:**
- Added sort select (default / Name A–Z / City A–Z) + email-only checkbox to results panel
- Refactored `_mapRenderPanel()` to read filter+sort state before building list

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `a19bc16`

---

### Step 3 — Results Side Panel (Discovery Map)

**Changes:**
- Added `#map-layout` flex wrapper around `#map-container` and new scrollable results panel
- Added `_mapResultItems[]` storing `{biz, marker}` pairs
- Added `_mapRenderPanel()` with click-to-zoom-and-popup behavior

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `c0caa17`

---

### Step 2 — Marker Clustering (Discovery Map)

**Changes:**
- Added Leaflet.markercluster v1.5.3 via CDN
- Initialized `L.markerClusterGroup()` inside `_mapInit()`
- Result markers now added to cluster group instead of directly to map

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `38da7c3`

## 2026-03-14

### Step 1 — Dashboard Navigation Restructure

**Goal:** Reduce 13-tab flat nav to a structured 5-section nav with sub-tabs.

**Changes:**
- Rebuilt top navigation from 13 flat tabs to 5 parent sections: Pipeline | Discovery | Clients | Health | Tools
- Added sub-tab system mapping to original page divs
- All original page divs preserved. No backend changes.

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `1dc811a`

---

### Search History Improvements

**Changes:**
- Added summary stats to search history view
- Added rerun buttons to past search entries

**Commit:** `bcac905`

---
### Step 8 — Search Visible Area Button

**Goal:** Add a "Search Visible Area" button that tiles the current map viewport into 1000m-radius grid cells and runs sequential `/api/discover_area` calls.

**Changes:**
- `#btnSearchVisible` + `#btnCancelVisible` added to map toolbar
- `let _mapVisibleSearchActive` — loop-control flag
- `let _mapVisibleSeenKeys` — cross-tile Set for deduplicating markers
- `_mapAppendResultMarkers(markers)` — additive marker helper; never calls `_mapClearResultMarkers`
- `_mapVisibleTiles()` — tiles current viewport into lat/lng grid at 2000m step; rejects runs > 30 tiles
- `mapSearchVisible()` — sequential tiled discovery; 1200ms inter-tile delay; dedup via `_mapVisibleSeenKeys`
- `_mapCancelVisible()` — sets cancel flag; status text update

**Files changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `32ff2bf`

---

### Step 8a — Decouple Search Visible Area Button from Circle State

**Goal:** Remove erroneous dependency on `_mapCenter` / circle lifecycle from `#btnSearchVisible` enable/disable logic.

**Changes (3 lines removed, 1 line modified):**
1. `#map-industry` onchange — removed `||!window._mapCenter` condition.
2. `_mapDrawCircle()` — removed 2 lines that set `btnSearchVisible.disabled`.
3. `mapClearCircle()` — removed 1 line that set `btnSearchVisible.disabled = true`.

**Files changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `651df94`

---

### Pass 9a — Queue Visual Safety

**Goal:** Make scheduled/approved/draft states visually distinct in the outreach queue.

**Changes:**
- Added `.badge-scheduled`, `row-scheduled` CSS, `.panel-save-state` state variants.
- `statusBadge(row)` — new `🕐 Scheduled` amber pill for `send_after && !sent_at` rows.
- Added `🕐 Scheduled` filter tab.
- `panelFieldChanged()` — body edits drive `#panel-save-state`: `Saving…` / `Saved ✓` / `Error saving`.

**Files changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `f712909`

---

### Pass 9b — Scheduled Send Intent

**Goal:** Add `send_after` field to all queue schemas and wire a "Schedule for Tomorrow" button.

**Protected systems modified deliberately:**
- `run_lead_engine.py`, `dashboard_server.py`, `email_sender_agent.py`, `followup_scheduler.py`, `reply_checker.py` — all `PENDING_COLUMNS` extended
- `reply_checker.py` truncated 20-col schema bug fixed simultaneously

**Commits:**
- `24dc5b2` — add send_after to all queue schemas; fix reply_checker column truncation
- `52dd64a` — /api/schedule_email route (intent-only, no send trigger)
- `a5f09c5` — Schedule for Tomorrow button in review panel

---

### Pass 10 — Scheduled Queue UX

**Goal:** Make scheduled rows clearly usable day-to-day.

**Changes:**
- `/api/schedule_email` now accepts `send_after: ""` to clear a schedule.
- `_formatSendAfter(isoStr)` — returns Today/Tomorrow/weekday labels.
- Active filter now excludes `send_after` rows.
- Scheduled filter sorts by `send_after` asc.
- `#panel-schedule-info` added to panel with Clear / +1 day / +2 / +3 actions.
- `panelClearSchedule()` and `panelReschedule(days)` added.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `d31d720`
### 2026-03-17 - Pass 31: Contact Quality Upgrade

**Goal:** Increase the number of outreach-ready leads by extracting more usable contacts and cleaning message outputs without redesigning the broader system.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/discovery/auto_prospect_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/intelligence/email_extractor_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**
- Expanded website email extraction to handle `mailto:` links with query strings, email-bearing attributes, simple `[at]` / `[dot]` obfuscation, paired `data-user` + `data-domain` attributes, and Cloudflare protected email tokens.
- Added bounded contact-page discovery and centralized website contact extraction so discovery and enrichment use the same logic.
- Strengthened extracted-email cleanup and candidate ranking so junk/placeholder values are suppressed more safely and stronger role/domain matches are preferred.
- Replaced the `email_extractor_agent.py` compatibility stub with a working enrichment pass for `prospects.csv`.
- Cleaned up outreach copy pools and guardrails to remove intentional sloppy phrasing, reduce awkward/run-on outputs, and keep social/contact-form companion drafts aligned with the shorter human style.
- Kept the pass off the protected systems: no queue schema, sender core, scheduler core, follow-up system, or `run_lead_engine.py` changes.

**Verification:**
- Ran `python -m py_compile` on all touched product files.
- Ran a targeted Python verification script that exercised representative hidden-email patterns, candidate ranking, enrichment updates on a temporary prospects CSV, and multiple email/social draft outputs.
- Reconfirmed the live dashboard still loads at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` after the backend changes.

**Commit:** `3098082`

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 30: Discovery Panel Organization + Edit Stability

**Goal:** Make large discovery result sets manageable inside the dashboard without redesigning the rest of the workflow.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**
- Reorganized the discovery results rail into grouped sections with workflow, city, email-status, and flat grouping modes.
- Switched the panel to score-first ordering by default and added clearer metadata density for faster scanning.
- Added active-result highlighting and an explicit `Edit` action from discovery results into the existing review panel.
- Stabilized review-panel navigation by anchoring it to a snapshot of the visible lead set instead of only the live filtered table.
- Updated panel actions to use the anchored row context so edit, approve, schedule, unschedule, campaign, and contact-log interactions keep the same lead open.
- Prevented accidental review-panel dismissal from overlay clicks and blocked close while debounced saves are still pending.
- Kept the pass frontend-only. No scheduler core, queue schema, sender, follow-up, or protected pipeline systems changed.

**Verification:**
- Extracted inline dashboard JavaScript and ran `node --check` successfully.
- Ran a live headless-browser smoke pass against the local dashboard server using a synthetic client-side discovery dataset to verify grouped result rendering, group switching, active selection, edit stability, close-guard behavior, and basic Pass 29 control availability without writing real queue edits.
- Confirmed only `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html` changed in product code.
- Reconfirmed protected systems were untouched.

**Commit:** `5d11595`

---

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 29: Discovery Coverage Expansion + Bulk Unschedule

**Goal:** Expand neighborhood discovery coverage from the existing map circle and let operators unschedule batches of scheduled outreach safely.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**
- Restored `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html` from the last committed baseline after a failed transfer left the live file as a 63-byte broken stub.
- Added `Search Area Grid` UI using the current map circle as a capped 1000m-cell grid.
- Added multi-industry grid selection, run estimation, hard caps of 36 cells / 120 calls, compact progress status, cancel support, and a single summarized history entry per grid sweep.
- Added current-run dedupe for accumulated grid markers using place ID first and stable fallbacks.
- Added bulk `Unschedule` to the outreach table and allowed scheduled rows to be selected in the Scheduled filter.
- Smoke stabilization fixed one UI bug so bulk `Unschedule` is visibly shown when scheduled rows are selected.
- Kept the pass frontend-only. No scheduler core, queue schema, sender, or follow-up systems changed.

**Verification:**
- Extracted inline dashboard JavaScript and ran `node --check` successfully.
- Ran a live headless-browser smoke checklist covering dashboard load, grid UI, multi-industry selection, oversized blocking, status updates, cancel recovery, history rendering, scheduled-row selection, bulk unschedule visibility/state, and existing single/visible/exhaust discovery actions.
- Confirmed only `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html` changed in product code.
- Confirmed protected files (`run_lead_engine.py`, queue schema/pipeline, scheduler core) were untouched.

**Commit:** `aaa3276`

---
### 2026-03-17 - Pass 32: Discovery Triage + Lead Qualification Controls

**Goal:** Reduce operator friction between discovery and outreach by making newly found leads faster to qualify into work-now, maybe-later, needs-contact, and weak/skip buckets.

**Changes:**
- Added a frontend-only qualification model in the discovery results rail using existing lead/result signals such as email presence, website/phone availability, queue state, and existing score/contactability hints.
- Added quick triage chips with live counts for `All`, `Ready`, `Maybe`, `Needs Contact`, `Weak`, and `No Email`.
- Added `Group: Qualification` to the discovery panel so large result sets can be sectioned by readiness rather than only workflow/city/email.
- Added compact qualification badges and reason chips on each discovery result to explain at a glance why a lead is strong, weak, or blocked by missing contactability.
- Kept Pass 30 edit stability intact by preserving the visible review context and verifying that overlay clicks still do not dismiss the review panel.

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Commit:** `8868847`

---
### 2026-03-17 - Pass 33: Bulk Discovery-to-Outreach Workflow Acceleration

**Goal:** Reduce repetitive operator work once strong discovery leads have been identified by making the visible qualified subset faster to move into outreach review/actions.

**Changes:**
- Added a discovery-panel handoff layer built around the current visible subset after triage/filtering instead of forcing row-by-row `Edit` clicks.
- Added `Review Visible` to open the current visible discovery subset directly in the outreach review panel.
- Added `Prep Outreach` to bulk-approve outreach-ready visible rows and then open that prepared subset in review.
- Added compact visible-set summary counts for reviewable rows, outreach-ready rows, and rows that still need approval.
- Tightened discovery bulk actions to use the actual visible queue-row context rather than weaker business-name matching, keeping bulk behavior aligned with the current qualified view.

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Commit:** `c1a56a4`

---
### 2026-03-17 - Pass 35: Scheduling Clarity + Queue Timeline UX

**Goal:** Make outreach queue timing and scheduled state easier to understand without changing scheduler logic.

**Changes:**
- Added a queue timeline explainer bar under the outreach filters so operators can tell how `Actionable`, `Approved`, `Scheduled`, and `All` relate to future send windows.
- Added a queue-state helper layer that distinguishes future scheduled rows from schedule-window-reached rows and clearer ready-now approved rows.
- Added exact plus relative local-time schedule formatting and expanded the review-panel schedule block with clearer waiting vs ready-now explanations.
- Updated scheduling feedback copy so schedule/unschedule actions clearly explain whether a row is waiting for later or back in a ready-now queue.

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Verification:**
- Extracted the inline dashboard JavaScript and ran `node --check`.
- Ran a live headless-browser smoke pass against `http://127.0.0.1:5000` with a synthetic queue subset and stubbed API writes to verify queue timeline notes, status clarity, review-panel timing explanations, schedule/unschedule transitions, schedule button wording, and basic Pass 29 discovery control availability.
- Reconfirmed the pass stayed frontend-only and did not touch protected systems.

**Commit:** `4e18c3c`

---

### 2026-03-17 - Pass 34: Outreach Review Throughput + Queue Control

**Goal:** Increase operator throughput while reviewing large outreach subsets after discovery handoff.

**Changes:**
- Added review-session context directly inside the outreach panel with a clear subset label and live queue-state counts for the active review set.
- Added context-aware quick flow actions: `Approve + Next`, `Schedule + Next`, `Unschedule + Next`, `Undo + Next`, and `Skip`.
- Added keyboard shortcuts for faster sequential review (`A`, `Shift+A`, `S`, `Shift+S`, `U`, `N`, and arrow navigation) without changing scheduler or sender logic.
- Preserved Pass 33 discovery-to-review continuity by carrying a `Discovery review subset` label into the outreach panel when review opens from discovery-visible subsets.

**Files touched:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**Verification:**
- Extracted the inline dashboard JavaScript and ran `node --check`.
- Ran a live headless-browser smoke pass against `http://127.0.0.1:5000` with a synthetic review subset and stubbed API writes to verify subset labeling, queue visibility, rapid review actions, skip/next flow, overlay-close protection, and basic Pass 29 discovery control availability.
- Reconfirmed the pass stayed frontend-only and did not touch protected systems.

**Commit:** `67716ce`

---
### 2026-03-19 - Pass 51: Observation Autowrite + Candidate Approval Layer

**Goal:** Generate grounded observation candidates from real available lead
context so operators can approve/edit observations faster without weakening the
existing observation-led drafting standard.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/outreach/observation_candidate_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_engine/outreach/observation_candidate_agent.py`:
- Added deterministic observation candidate generation with four explicit
  families:
  `prior_observation_restore`, `limited_contact_methods`,
  `single_contact_route`, and `phone_only_listing`.
- Added shared observation validation for save/regenerate paths:
  `observation_missing`, `observation_too_short`, `observation_generic`,
  `observation_too_long`, `observation_banned_language`.
- Added candidate blocking for weak or unsafe generation:
  `weak_source_context`, `insufficient_context`,
  `invalid_missing_context_overlap`.
- Candidate generation only uses safe existing evidence:
  saved lead memory observations, matched prospect contactability, visible
  contact routes on file, and specific queue insight signals/sentences when
  they support a concrete operational/contact-path note.

`lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`:
- Added `POST /api/generate_observation_candidate`.
- Added `_read_prospects()` and `_find_matching_prospect(...)` so candidate
  generation can reuse current stored prospect context without schema changes.
- Updated `POST /api/update_observation` to use shared observation validation and
  return structured blocked reasons on invalid requests.
- Updated `POST /api/regenerate_draft` to validate the observation again before
  rebuilding the draft, preserving observation-led protections.

`lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`:
- Added observation tooling actions in the existing panel:
  `Generate Obs`, `Save Observation`, `Use Candidate`,
  `Regenerate Candidate`.
- Added observation candidate UI states:
  loading, ready, blocked, evidence preview, rationale, source labels, and
  confidence/family metadata.
- Added `apiJson(...)` helper for observation routes that need structured
  non-200 JSON handling.
- Existing panel flow now supports:
  generate candidate -> review/use/edit -> save observation -> regenerate draft.
- Candidate generation auto-runs when the panel opens on an unsent row with no
  saved observation and no existing candidate state.

**Design decisions:**
- Did not touch `run_lead_engine.py`.
- Did not change queue column order or naming.
- Did not change scheduler timing or due-date math.
- Did not change email sender core.
- Did not auto-accept generated observations.
- Did not add hidden background bulk mutation of all leads.

**Verification:**
- Dashboard JS parses clean via `new vm.Script(...)`.
- Python imports clean for `lead_engine.dashboard_server` and
  `lead_engine.outreach.observation_candidate_agent`.
- Flask test client checks on the local repo:
  - `Massie Heating and Air Conditioning` -> ready candidate,
    family `limited_contact_methods`
  - `Integrity Auto Care` -> blocked candidate,
    `blocked_reason=weak_source_context`
  - invalid save with `need more leads from better marketing` -> `400`,
    `blocked_reason=observation_banned_language`
  - invalid regenerate with the same observation -> `400`,
    `blocked_reason=observation_banned_language`
- Current queue pass through the candidate layer:
  `49` ready rows, `131` blocked rows
  (`110` `weak_source_context`, `21` `insufficient_context`).

**Commit:** `aea9452`

### 2026-03-19 - Docs Governance Sync: Observation Candidate Era

**Goal:** Align the repo-state and startup docs to the actual post-Pass-51
system without changing product code.

**Files changed:**
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`
- `docs/AI_START_HERE.md`
- `docs/AI_DEV_STANDARDS.md`

**What changed:**

`docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`:
- Kept Pass 51 as the latest completed product pass.
- Clarified that observation-led drafting still blocks when no valid
  observation exists.
- Updated the core workflow so observations may be operator-authored or
  system-generated candidates, with operator review/edit still in the loop.

`docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`:
- Reframed the active session as a docs-only governance sync instead of a new
  product implementation pass.
- Made the post-Pass-51 observation-candidate baseline explicit.
- Marked the repo as ready for the next intended product pass:
  territory heatmap overlay.

`docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`:
- Updated the current build pass to this docs sync while keeping Pass 51 as the
  last completed product pass.
- Added governance distinction language between protected delivery-core systems
  and additive operator-visible intelligence layers.
- Added active constraints for generated observations, operator review default,
  and no hidden bulk mutation / auto-accept behavior.

`docs/AI_START_HERE.md` and `docs/AI_DEV_STANDARDS.md`:
- Removed manual-only observation framing from startup guidance.
- Added explicit wording that protected delivery-core systems remain constrained
  while additive intelligence layers may evolve carefully when truthful,
  documented, reversible, and operator-visible.

**Design decisions:**
- Did not change product code.
- Did not change protected system definitions in `PROTECTED_SYSTEMS.md`.
- Did not broaden sender, queue, scheduler, or orchestration permissions.

**Verification:**
- Verified repo-state docs now point to Pass 51 as the last completed product pass.
- Verified startup/governance docs now reflect the observation-candidate model
  and operator-review default.
- Verified this pass is documentation only.

**Commit:** `00cf75e`

### 2026-03-19 - Pass 52: Territory Heatmap Overlay

**Goal:** Turn the discovery map into a territory-aware working tool that shows
stored search coverage, lead concentration, and oversaturation risk so the
operator can choose the next area to search more deliberately.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`:
- Added read-only `GET /api/map_territory_overlay`.
- The route aggregates three verified sources only:
  - `search_history.json` area-search rows
  - `city_planner.json` AREA planner rows
  - `prospects.csv` rows with stored `lat` / `lng`
- Returns coarse territory cells with:
  lead counts, lead-industry counts, search counts, successful-search counts,
  duplicate-heavy counts, planner-check counts, planner lead totals, and a
  truthful note that the cells are neighborhood guidance rather than exact
  boundaries.

`lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`:
- Added map controls:
  `Territory Overlay`, `Next Areas`, and `Refresh Overlay`.
- Added a Leaflet territory layer that renders coarse cells only from persisted
  search/planner/lead data.
- Added territory legend cards for:
  `Next Areas`, `Worked`, and `Saturation Risk`.
- Added per-cell popup guidance plus `Use This Cell`, which moves the existing
  search circle to the selected cell without auto-running discovery.
- Overlay refreshes after map discovery runs so territory coverage stays aligned
  with the current stored repo data.

**Design decisions:**
- Did not change `run_lead_engine.py`.
- Did not change queue schema order or naming.
- Did not change sender core, send-path behavior, scheduler timing, or due-date math.
- Did not introduce fake neighborhood or polygon precision.
- Used a coarse cell model because the repo stores search centers and prospect
  coordinates, not exact territory boundaries.

**Verification:**
- Python imports clean for `lead_engine.dashboard_server`.
- Dashboard JS parses clean via `new vm.Script(...)`.
- Flask test client:
  - `GET /api/map_territory_overlay` -> `200`
  - returned `386` territory cells
  - summary built from `226` area-search rows, `11` AREA planner rows, and
    `613` coordinate-bearing prospects
- Live local app HTML at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` contains the new map UI:
  `Territory Overlay`, `Next Areas`, `map-territory-legend`,
  and `mapReloadTerritoryOverlay`

**Commit:** `6285e65`

### 2026-03-19 - Pass 52a: Observation Route Recovery + Discovery Connection Hardening + Circle Interaction Review

**Goal:** Fix the observation-candidate panel's raw HTML failure mode, make
discovery errors surface clearly, and bring the map interaction back in line
with Pass 52's territory-cell workflow without rewriting discovery itself.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`
- `docs/DISCOVERY_MAP_VISION.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`:
- Hardened request/error recovery so observation candidate actions no longer
  surface raw Flask HTML when the live dashboard instance responds with a
  non-JSON error page.
- Root cause fixed:
  the frontend had been accepting non-JSON `404` HTML bodies from a stale
  dashboard instance and piping them straight into the observation candidate
  panel.
- Observation candidate failures now resolve to clean operator-facing blocked
  messaging, including route-unavailable wording for stale-route/stale-server
  cases.
- Discovery requests now use structured JSON handling for
  `/api/discover_area` and `/api/discover_area_batch`, so real backend
  validation or server errors no longer collapse into a vague
  "Connection error".
- Grid sweep and visible-area runs still preserve partial progress, but now
  surface request-issue counts and the latest useful error text in status/toast
  messaging.
- Territory overlay copy now makes cells the preferred starting point for area
  selection, while keeping the circle as the working search geometry used by
  the current radius-based discovery endpoints.
- `Use Cell`, reset, and initial map status messaging now reinforce the
  territory-first workflow instead of the older circle-first framing.

**Design decisions:**
- Did not change `dashboard_server.py`.
- Did not change queue schema order/names.
- Did not change sender, scheduler timing, or send-path behavior.
- Did not remove the circle because current discovery endpoints are still
  center/radius-based.
- Did not add hidden fallback behavior that fakes a successful observation or
  discovery run.

**Verification:**
- Dashboard JS parses clean via `new vm.Script(...)`.
- Flask test client:
  - `POST /api/generate_observation_candidate` invalid row -> `400` JSON
  - `POST /api/discover_area` missing coords -> `400` JSON
  - `POST /api/discover_area_batch` missing coords -> `400` JSON
  - `GET /api/map_territory_overlay` -> `200`
- Live local app check on the already-running dashboard instance:
  - `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/map_territory_overlay` still returned `404`,
    which matches the stale-server route mismatch this pass now hardens in the
    UI instead of dumping raw HTML into the observation panel.

**Commit:** `fdbd2fb`

### 2026-03-19 - Pass 54: On-Demand Observation Evidence Refresh

**Goal:** Add an operator-triggered, single-lead evidence refresh path so the
review panel can re-check live website/contact signals, store safe lead-side
updates, and retry grounded observation candidate generation without weakening
observation-led drafting rules.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `lead_engine/intelligence/website_scan_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/intelligence/observation_evidence_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/outreach/observation_candidate_agent.py`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`:
- Added `POST /api/refresh_observation_evidence`.
- The route validates the current row, refreshes website/contact evidence for
  that single lead, writes lead-side updates, and reruns observation candidate
  generation before responding.
- The route returns structured refresh metadata plus either a ready candidate or
  a blocked reason/message.

`lead_engine/intelligence/observation_evidence_agent.py`:
- Added a deterministic evidence refresh helper for one lead.
- Reused the existing website fallback, contact extraction, and bounded website
  scan logic.
- Added bounded site-signal extraction for:
  specialty/service cues, emergency or same-day language, estimate/booking
  language, and explicit service-area coverage.
- Added refresh-specific blocked reasons:
  `no_retrievable_source`, `fetch_failed`,
  `generic_template_language`, and `no_concrete_business_signal`.

`lead_engine/intelligence/website_scan_agent.py`:
- Added a capped `text_corpus` output to the existing bounded site scan so the
  refresh helper can derive evidence from the same fetch pass.

`lead_engine/outreach/observation_candidate_agent.py`:
- Added support for `fresh site evidence` already stored on the lead.
- The regular candidate route can now reuse refreshed insight fields after a
  successful refresh, not just the immediate refresh response.

`lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`:
- Added `Refresh Evidence` in the observation tool row and candidate box.
- Added a refresh-specific loading state and in-panel handling for clean ready
  or blocked outcomes.
- Refresh now updates the AI Insight section, candidate box, and operator
  status text in place.

**Design decisions:**
- Kept refresh operator-triggered and single-lead only.
- Did not auto-save or auto-accept the observation.
- Did not touch `run_lead_engine.py`.
- Did not change queue schema ordering/naming.
- Did not change sender, scheduler timing, or send-path behavior.
- Did not silently persist fallback websites into lead identity fields in this
  pass, to avoid fragmenting lead-memory identity.

**Verification:**
- Python compile checks passed for the new/updated intelligence, candidate, and
  dashboard server files.
- Dashboard JS parses clean via `new vm.Script(...)`.
- Flask test client against temporary fixtures built from real repo rows:
  - `Massie Heating and Air Conditioning` -> `200`, ready candidate:
    `site is pretty explicit about ductless mini-split work and emergency service.`
  - `Premier Auto Repairs` -> `200`, ready candidate:
    `site is pretty explicit about brake work and service scheduling.`
  - `Dunham Plumbing LLC` -> `200`, refresh blocked reason
    `no_retrievable_source`, with the route still returning the existing
    phone-only candidate path truthfully.
  - After refresh, the normal `/api/generate_observation_candidate` route
    reused the stored fresh evidence on the refreshed `Massie...` fixture and
    returned the same candidate.

### 2026-03-19 - Pass 55: First-Touch Service Positioning Hardening

**Goal:** Tighten first-touch outreach so drafts stay observation-led while
positioning Drew's real offer as practical owner/operator workflow help, not
generic consulting or hypey automation copy.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/AI_CONTROL_PANEL.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

**What changed:**

`lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`:
- Bumped `DRAFT_VERSION` from `v9` to `v10`.
- Replaced the old first-touch body families with deterministic offer angles:
  `after_hours_response`, `estimate_follow_up`, `service_requests`,
  `inquiry_routing`, `callback_recovery`, and `owner_workflow`.
- First-touch body construction now follows one bounded pattern:
  observation -> operational consequence -> what Drew helps with -> soft ask.
- Added deterministic offer language so drafts can mention believable practical
  fixes like missed-call text back, after-hours response, estimate follow-up,
  contact routing, callback recovery, intake capture, or simple lead tracking
  when the observation supports that direction.
- Added new deterministic validation guards that block vague positioning like
  `workflow gap`, `another set of eyes`, or `business side`, and require at
  least one concrete service-business bottleneck/fix signal in the final draft.
- Kept observation-required drafting intact; no observation still blocks and
  generic observation still blocks.

**Design decisions:**
- Did not change `run_lead_engine.py`.
- Did not change queue schema order/naming.
- Did not change the email sender, pending email pipeline, or send path.
- Did not change follow-up drafting or scheduler timing/core logic.
- Did not bundle discovery, map, or observation-refresh work into this pass.

**Verification:**
- Python compile check passed for `lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`.
- Direct draft-agent verification passed:
  - missing observation blocks
  - generic observation blocks
  - vague positioning blocks
  - banned sales language blocks
- Example first-touch outputs now produce concrete service-positioned copy for:
  - `Massie Heating and Air Conditioning`
  - `Premier Auto Repairs`
  - `Acme Plumbing`
