### Pass 11 — Sent Mail Reconciliation Recovery

**Goal:** Prevent duplicate resends when Gmail sends succeeded but the dashboard closed before queue state updated.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/outreach/reply_checker.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**What changed:**
- Added `reconcile_sent_mail()` to scan recent Gmail Sent messages and reconcile only approved+unsent queue rows.
- Matching key is strict: recipient email + exact subject, limited to recent sent window (`lookback_hours`, default 72h).
- Ambiguity handling is fail-safe: if multiple queue rows share a key or multiple Sent messages match a key, rows are skipped and not modified.
- Added dashboard API endpoint `/api/reconcile_sent` and UI action `↺ Check Sent` to trigger operator recovery.
- Reconciliation writes `sent_at` and captures Gmail `Message-ID` when present; no lead deletion and no resend path invoked.

**Commit:** `aae0cb5`

### Pass 12 — Queue Bulk Action + Unschedule Fix

**Goal:** Restore reliable checked-row bulk approvals and provide explicit unschedule action in the panel UI.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**What changed:**
- Fixed bulk Approve / Unapprove race by replacing parallel `Promise.all` queue writes with sequential row updates.
- Kept bulk Delete/Clear and single-row approve/unapprove behavior intact.
- Changed schedule panel button from `Clear` to explicit `Unschedule` for operator clarity.
- Unschedule path reuses guarded `/api/schedule_email` with `send_after: ""`; no new route added.
- No send logic changes, no queue schema changes, no protected backend edits.

**Commit:** `c40d16d`

## 2026-03-16


### Pass 13 — Dashboard Startup Import Recovery

**Goal:** Restore dashboard startup by resolving missing symbols/modules in the server import chain.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/discovery/prospect_discovery_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/run_lead_engine.py`
- `lead_engine/intelligence/website_scan_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/outreach/email_draft_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/scoring/opportunity_scoring_agent.py`
- `lead_engine/city_planner.py`
- `lead_engine/intelligence/email_extractor_agent.py`

**What changed:**
- Added missing `clean_website_for_key()` to discovery agent.
- Removed stale `normalize_business_name` import from `run_lead_engine.py`.
- Added compatibility helpers expected by `run_lead_engine.py` (`generate_lead_insight`, `draft_social_messages`, `DRAFT_VERSION`, `compute_numeric_score`, `score_priority_label`).
- Added missing modules imported by dashboard server (`city_planner`, `email_extractor_agent`).
- Verified `dashboard_server.py` starts and binds to localhost without the previous import errors.

**Commit:** `c2234ea`

## 2026-03-16

### Pass 14 — Dashboard UX Safety Cleanup

**Goal:** Remove misleading/dead dashboard actions and clarify operator-facing copy without backend changes.

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**What changed:**
- Disabled active navigation into broken client leads surface by making `mcViewLeads` informational only.
- Kept client Leads/Delete surfaces disabled and added explicit tooltips for both.
- Relabeled conversation quick actions to copy-oriented language while preserving clipboard behavior.
- Added safety confirmation to `Approve All` including affected row count and explicit write warning.
- Added short map disclosure note clarifying queue/draft authority and partial marker expectations.
- Marked Tools tab as `Stub` in top navigation.

**Commit:** `014e68c`

## 2026-03-15

### Pass A — Operator Safety Fixes

**Goal:** Prevent broken outreach messages and fix confusing UI without
touching any protected systems.

**Changes:**

1. **`COPPERLINE_LINKS` config block** added at top of JS (above `let allRows`).
   Contains `demo`, `booking`, `caseStudy` URL slots. Operator updates these
   once before sending live templates. `_clinkOr(url, fallback)` helper
   returns the URL if configured, or a `⚠` warning string if still default.

2. **`cvSendQuick` templates** now reference `COPPERLINE_LINKS` via `_clinkOr`.
   If any link is unconfigured, the `⚠` string appears in the copied text AND
   an error toast fires: `⚠ Template contains unconfigured link`. Operator
   cannot accidentally send `[INSERT DEMO LINK]` to a live lead.
   Call template now includes a booking link instead of open-ended question.

3. **`mcRenderClients` table headers** corrected: Twilio Number / Owner Phone /
   Sheet / Notify → Phone / SMS Reply / Status (matches actual backend schema).

4. **`mcRenderClients` tbody cells** corrected: `c.twilio_number` / `c.owner_phone`
   / `c.sheet_name` / `c.notification_channel` (all non-existent) →
   `c.phone`, `c.sms_reply`, `c.active` status badge.

5. **Leads and Delete buttons** in client rows: `disabled` + `opacity:.4` +
   `title="Feature not available yet"`. No longer fire broken 404 routes.

6. **Service badge** initial text: `● Missed-Call: Not Configured` with tooltip
   `"The missed-call automation service has not been configured yet.
   This does not affect discovery or outreach."` `mcCheckHealth` still
   overrides to Online/Offline if the service actually starts running.

**Protected systems modified:** None.
**Backend files modified:** None.
**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `4a169dd`

### Clients Route Fix

**Root cause:** Frontend was calling `/api/mc/clients`, `/api/mc/clients/new`,
and `/api/mc/run_demo`. Backend never had those paths — it implements
`/api/clients`, `/api/clients/add`, and `/api/demo_run` respectively. The
mismatch caused 404s that surfaced as `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input`
before the `api()` HTTP guard was in place.

**Fixes:**
- `mcApi()`: added `r.ok` guard matching the `api()` fix in `2b202cd`
- `mcLoadClients()` (×2 call sites): `/api/mc/clients` → `/api/clients`
- `mcSaveNewClient()`: `/api/mc/clients/new` → `/api/clients/add`
- `mcRunDemo()`: `/api/mc/run_demo` → `/api/demo_run`

**Remaining unimplemented:** `DELETE /api/mc/clients/{id}` and
`GET /api/mc/clients/{id}/leads` — no backend routes exist for these.
Buttons will show a clean error toast. Backend work needed separately.

**Schema note:** Backend client fields use `client_id`, `business_name`,
`phone`, `sms_reply`. Frontend renders `c.twilio_number` which is not in the
backend schema — that cell will render blank until schema is aligned.

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `4c390fe`

---

### Runtime Verification Hotfixes

**Diagnosed from live browser session (5 screenshots + console log).**

**Root causes found:**
- `api()` called `r.json()` unconditionally. `/api/mc/clients` (missing backend
  route) returns 404 HTML. Parsing `<!DOCTYPE html>` as JSON throws
  `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input at (index):1:10`. Fired on every
  health check cycle (30s interval) and every Clients tab open.
- Map `click` event repositioned the active circle on any tile click, wiping
  result markers without warning.
- `Clear Coverage` button was near-invisible (text color `var(--dim)`).

**Fixes:**
- `api()`: added `if (!r.ok)` guard — throws `Error("API /path returned N: ...")`
  on non-OK responses. All callers have `try/catch` so errors surface cleanly.
- `_mapInit` click handler: wraps `_mapDrawCircle` in
  `if (_mapResultItems.length === 0)` guard. Circle repositions freely when
  no results loaded; locked once results are present until `X Clear` used.
- `.btn-coverage`: raised text to `var(--muted)`, border to `var(--border-hi)`,
  hover to `var(--text)` + blue border.

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `2b202cd`

**Parse check:** `vm.Script` PARSE OK on served JS post-fix.

---

### Emergency Fix — Duplicate `let _currentPage` SyntaxError

**Root cause:** Stale duplicate `let _currentPage = 'outreach'` declaration
left over from the Step 1 nav restructure (commit `1dc811a`). The duplicate
sat at line 2011, above the real declaration at line 2018. Browsers enforce
strict `let` uniqueness in script scope and threw a fatal parse error:

`Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier '_currentPage' has already been declared`

This killed the entire script block at parse time — nothing functioned.

**Diagnosis path:** Browser DevTools console showed the exact error at line
2018. Node `vm.Script` parse check on the served JS confirmed the issue and
confirmed the fix.

**Fix:** Removed the 5-line stale block (orphaned comment + duplicate `let`).
Single declaration at line 2013 remains.

**Commit:** `761faaf`

### Step 7 — Human-Readable Discovery Labels

**Goal:** Replace raw coordinates as primary history label with a city name
derived from already-loaded result data.

**Changes:**
- Added `_mapAreaLabel(markers)`: frequency-counts `biz.city` across result
  set, returns most common city name, null if no city data present
- Wired `mapSearch()` `res.ok`: computes label before history unshift,
  stores as `label` field on history entry
- Updated `_mapRenderHistory()`: `entry.label` as primary (fallback to
  `lat/lng` coords); secondary shows `X.X mi — N found`; exact coords
  preserved as `title` attribute for hover

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `3f86767`

---

### Step 6 — Discovery History List

**Goal:** Session-only recent searches list below the map. Click to refocus.

**Changes:**
- Added `_mapSearchHistory[]`, `MAP_HISTORY_MAX = 10`
- Added `_mapRenderHistory()`: builds `.mh-item` rows with `lat/lng`, radius
  in miles, and `found` count; click handler sets `_mapRadiusM`, calls
  `_mapDrawCircle()`, then `setView()` to recenter
- Added `_mapClearHistory()`: resets array, hides `#map-history`
- Added `#map-history` HTML below `#map-status` (hidden until first entry)
- Added CSS: `#map-history`, `.mh-hdr`, `.mh-title`, `.mh-clear`,
  `.mh-list`, `.mh-item`, `.mh-item-label`, `.mh-item-meta`
- Wired `mapSearch()` `res.ok`: `unshift` entry, trim to `MAP_HISTORY_MAX`,
  call `_mapRenderHistory()`
- Coverage, clustering, result markers unchanged

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `6d79c64`

---

### Step 5 — Discovery Coverage Memory

**Goal:** Persist prior search areas as faint map overlays for the current
session so the operator can see where they have already searched.

**Changes:**
- Added `_mapCoverageCircles[]` module variable
- Added `_mapClearCoverage()` — calls `.remove()` on each overlay, resets
  array, hides `btnClearCoverage`
- Added `.btn-coverage` CSS class for the toolbar button
- Added `#btnClearCoverage` button to map toolbar (`display:none` by default)
- Wired `mapSearch()` `res.ok` branch to snapshot `_mapCenter` + `_mapRadiusM`
  as `L.circle` with `interactive:false`, `dashArray:'4 4'`, `fillOpacity:0.04`,
  blue tint — pushed to `_mapCoverageCircles[]`, button revealed
- Active circle, drag handle, clustering, result markers all unchanged

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `f27a472`

---

### Step 4 — Map Result Usability Polish

**Goal:** Add sort and filter controls to the results panel without touching
discovery flow, backend, or clustering.

**Changes:**
- Added CSS: `.mrp-controls`, `.mrp-ctrl-select`, `.mrp-ctrl-chk` classes
- Added HTML controls row (`#mrp-controls`) between header and list:
  sort select (default / Name A–Z / City A–Z) + email-only checkbox
- Refactored `_mapRenderPanel()` to read filter+sort state from DOM controls
  before building list; `_mapResultItems[]` is never mutated
- Count shows `(N of M)` when email filter is active
- Extended `_mapClearResultMarkers()` to reset `mrp-sort` and `mrp-email-only`

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `a19bc16`

---

### Step 3 — Results Side Panel (Discovery Map)

**Goal:** Show a scrollable list of discovered businesses alongside the map
after a discovery search completes.

**Changes:**
- Added CSS: `#map-layout`, `#map-results-panel`, `.mrp-hdr`, `.mrp-list`,
  `.mrp-item`, `.mrp-name`, `.mrp-meta`, `.mrp-dot` classes
- Added `#map-layout` flex wrapper in HTML around `#map-container` and new panel
- Added `#map-results-panel` div with header (`mrp-count`) and scrollable list
- Added `_mapResultItems[]` module variable storing `{biz, marker}` pairs
- Added `_mapRenderPanel()` — renders list items, binds click to
  `zoomToShowLayer()` + `openPopup()` per marker
- Extended `_mapClearResultMarkers()` to reset `_mapResultItems` and hide panel
- Extended `_mapPlaceResultMarkers()` to push to `_mapResultItems` and call render

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `c0caa17`

---

### Step 2 — Marker Clustering (Discovery Map)

**Goal:** Group discovery result markers into cluster bubbles that split on
zoom-in and regroup on zoom-out.

**Changes:**
- Added Leaflet.markercluster v1.5.3 CSS + JS via CDN (`<head>`)
- Added `_mapClusterGroup` module variable
- Initialized `L.markerClusterGroup()` inside `_mapInit()` after tile layer
- Changed result marker creation from `.addTo(_mapInstance)` to `.addTo(_mapClusterGroup)`
- Updated `_mapClearResultMarkers()` to call `_mapClusterGroup.clearLayers()`
- Drag handle and circle markers unchanged

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `38da7c3`

## 2026-03-14

### Step 1 — Dashboard Navigation Restructure

**Goal:** Reduce 13-tab flat nav to a structured 5-section nav with sub-tabs.

**Changes:**
- Rebuilt top navigation from 13 flat tabs to 5 parent sections
- Added sub-tab system mapping to original page divs
- Sections: Pipeline | Discovery | Clients | Health | Tools
- All original page divs preserved and intact
- No backend changes

**File changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `1dc811a`

---

### Search History Improvements

**Goal:** Improve usability of the Searches page in the dashboard.

**Changes:**
- Added summary stats to search history view
- Added rerun buttons to past search entries

**Commit:** `bcac905`

---

### Step 8 — Search Visible Area Button

**Date:** 2026-03-16

**Goal:** Add a "Search Visible Area" button that tiles the current map
viewport into 1000m-radius grid cells and runs sequential
`/api/discover_area` calls across each cell, accumulating markers without
clearing existing results.

**Changes:**

- `#btnSearchVisible` + `#btnCancelVisible` added to map toolbar
  (after `#btnMapSearch`, before Clear)
- `#map-industry` gains `onchange` to keep `#btnSearchVisible` synced
- `let _mapVisibleSearchActive` — loop-control flag
- `let _mapVisibleSeenKeys` — cross-tile Set for deduplicating markers
- `_mapRenderHistory()` — guards `radiusM: null`; shows "tiled" label;
  click handler no longer overwrites `_mapRadiusM` with null
- `_mapAppendResultMarkers(markers)` — additive marker helper; never
  calls `_mapClearResultMarkers`
- `_mapVisibleTiles()` — tiles current viewport into lat/lng grid at
  2000m step; rejects runs > 30 tiles
- `mapSearchVisible()` — sequential tiled discovery; 1200ms inter-tile
  delay; dedup via `_mapVisibleSeenKeys`; coverage circles per productive
  tile; single history entry with `radiusM: null` on completion
- `_mapCancelVisible()` — sets cancel flag; status text update
- `_mapDrawCircle` / `mapClearCircle` extended to mirror `#btnSearchVisible`
  enable/disable state

**Files changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `32ff2bf`

---

### Step 8a — Decouple Search Visible Area Button from Circle State

**Date:** 2026-03-16

**Goal:** Remove erroneous dependency on `_mapCenter` / circle lifecycle from
`#btnSearchVisible` enable/disable logic. Button should be gated on industry
selection only.

**Root cause:** Step 8 added `btnSearchVisible` enable/disable calls into
`_mapDrawCircle()` and `mapClearCircle()`, and the `onchange` handler on
`#map-industry` included `!window._mapCenter` as a secondary gate.

**Changes (3 lines removed, 1 line modified):**

1. `#map-industry` onchange — removed `||!window._mapCenter` condition.
   Button now enables on industry selection regardless of circle state.

2. `_mapDrawCircle()` — removed 2 lines that read `map-industry` value and
   set `btnSearchVisible.disabled`. Circle draw no longer affects button.

3. `mapClearCircle()` — removed 1 line that set `btnSearchVisible.disabled = true`.
   Clearing the circle no longer affects button.

**Preserved:**
- `mapSearchVisible()` still disables button during active run and re-enables on completion
- `#btnSearchVisible` starts `disabled` in HTML (correct — no industry selected yet)
- All other map behavior unchanged

**Files changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `651df94`

### Pass 9a — Queue Visual Safety

**Date:** 2026-03-16

**Goal:** Make scheduled/approved/draft states visually distinct in the
outreach queue without any backend changes. Add save state feedback to the
draft panel body editor.

**Changes (frontend-only, `index.html`):**

1. **CSS** — Added `.badge-scheduled`, `tbody tr.row-scheduled td:first-child`
   (amber left border), `.panel-save-state` with `.saving` / `.saved` /
   `.save-err` state variants.

2. **`statusBadge(row)`** — New priority slot between stale and approved:
   `send_after && !sent_at` → `🕐 Scheduled` amber pill with send time tooltip.

3. **Filter tab HTML** — `🕐 Scheduled` tab appended after `High Score`.

4. **`applyFiltersAndSort()`** — `scheduled` branch:
   `rows.filter(r => r.send_after && !r.sent_at)`.

5. **`renderTable()`** — `scheduledClass` variable added; applied to `<tr>`.

6. **`panelFieldChanged()`** — Body edits drive `#panel-save-state`:
   `Saving…` on keystroke, `Saved ✓` on resolve, `Error saving` on reject.
   Subject/email edits use silent save (unchanged).

**Pre-flight audit finding (blocking Pass 9b):**
`_write_pending_rows()` in `run_lead_engine.py` uses `PENDING_COLUMNS` as the
exclusive column list. Any `send_after` field written externally will be
silently stripped on next engine run. Pass 9b requires adding `send_after` to
`PENDING_COLUMNS` — a protected-system change needing operator approval.

**Files changed:** `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `f712909`

---

### Pass 9b — Scheduled Send Intent

**Date:** 2026-03-16

**Goal:** Add `send_after` field to all queue schemas and wire a "Schedule
for Tomorrow" button that writes send intent without triggering any send.

**Protected systems modified deliberately:**
- `run_lead_engine.py` — `PENDING_COLUMNS` extended
- `dashboard_server.py` — `PENDING_COLUMNS` extended + new route
- `send/email_sender_agent.py` — `PENDING_EMAIL_COLUMNS` extended
- `outreach/followup_scheduler.py` — `PENDING_COLUMNS` extended
- `outreach/reply_checker.py` — schema corrected (was truncated to 20 cols)

**Pre-flight audit finding resolved:**
`reply_checker.py` had a pre-existing data-loss bug: its `PENDING_COLUMNS`
was truncated to 20 fields. All reply-matched row writes silently stripped
21 fields. Fixed in Commit A alongside the schema extension.

---

**Commit A — `24dc5b2`**
`fix+feat: add send_after to all queue schemas; fix reply_checker column truncation`

Files: `run_lead_engine.py`, `dashboard_server.py`, `email_sender_agent.py`,
`followup_scheduler.py`, `reply_checker.py`

Appended `"send_after"` to end of all five `PENDING_COLUMNS` lists.
Replaced `reply_checker.py` truncated 20-col list with full 42-col schema.

Verification: all 5 modules 42 cols, `send_after` last, first-41 order
preserved. CSV loads 174 rows cleanly, `send_after` defaults to `""`.

---

**Commit B — `52dd64a`**
`feat: Pass 9b — /api/schedule_email route (intent-only, no send trigger)`

File: `dashboard_server.py`

Added `POST /api/schedule_email`. Validates index, business_name, send_after,
index/name match. Writes `send_after` only. No send triggered.

Verification: all 10 static checks passed.

---

**Commit C — `a5f09c5`**
`feat: Pass 9b — Schedule for Tomorrow button in review panel`

File: `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

Added `SEND_WINDOWS` const, `panelScheduleTomorrow()` function,
`#panel-schedule-btn` in panel footer, `fillPanel` show/hide wiring.
Button hidden on sent rows. Intent-only — no auto-send.

Verification: all 19 static checks passed.

---

### Pass 10 — Scheduled Queue UX

**Date:** 2026-03-16

**Goal:** Make scheduled rows clearly usable day-to-day — readable send times
in the table, panel schedule info block, clear/reschedule actions, Active
filter exclusion, and chronological sort of the Scheduled view.

**Changes:**

**`dashboard_server.py`:**
- `/api/schedule_email` updated to accept `send_after: ""` for clearing
- `send_after_raw is None` → 400 (absent); `""` → accepted (clears);
  non-empty string → schedules
- All identity/bounds/name-match validation preserved
- No other field touched, no send triggered

**`dashboard_static/index.html`:**
- `_formatSendAfter(isoStr)` — local date parser, returns Today/Tomorrow/weekday labels
- Table `td-status` cell: muted sub-line with formatted send time for scheduled rows
- `applyFiltersAndSort` Active filter: added `!r.send_after` exclusion
- `applyFiltersAndSort` Scheduled filter: added `localeCompare` sort by `send_after` asc
- CSS: `.panel-sched-info`, `.sched-time`, `.btn-sched-act` added
- `#panel-schedule-info` HTML element added to panel
- `fillPanel` extended: renders schedule info block with formatted time + 4 action buttons
- `panelClearSchedule()` — clears via `/api/schedule_email` with `send_after: ""`
- `panelReschedule(days)` — reschedules to today+N at SEND_WINDOWS time

**No send logic changed. No schema changes. No auto-send.**

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`

**Commit:** `d31d720`
